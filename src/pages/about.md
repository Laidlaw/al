F.U.T.U.R.E. Force was my first product. It was a comic that me & my buddies wrote, drew, printed and sold in middle school.[^1] We even managed to turn a small profit.

[^1]: The story was set in the future but, you know, it just occurred to me that the characters never realized they were in the future.

But there was a problem. The comics didn't translate to the web.[^2] They were just images grafted onto documents. 

[^2]:As far as I know, this problem still hasn’t been solved.

It was like watching the movie version of a Broadway play -- or watching anything when the audio track is a couple milliseconds off and makes the actor mouthing the lines seems like a robot.[^3]

[^3]: Or those Smart TVs with ambitious frame rates that made movies like The Godfather look like they were after school specials.

I couldn't ignore the dissonance. I thought I could solve it, so I taught myself to code.[^4]

[^4]: And boy did I take the scenic route. I think I learned everything in most inefficient way possible.

Spoiler: I never solved the problem. 

But my passion for telling stories with words and pictures fueled my desire to make things on the web.

## Anthropologist on Mars

I love to figure out how things work. When the characters in our comic went to Mars, I became obsessed with Mars and designed a layered farming colony powered off the planet's natural resources.[^5]

[^5]: I was working on that comic when my science teacher reminded the class about tomorrow's deadline for the (mandatory) science fair submissions. In what was probably my most Ferris Bueller moment, I stapled the Mars colony research and schematics to cheap poster board and won the regional science fair.

Years later I caught wind of another dissonant chord. It was my first week at an agency where the designers and developers were local legend. By the end of the week, the designers were murmuring. 

The product, set to launch the next week, was fundamentally broken. It was like they built a jet without a cockpit. I saw the strangest scene play out: the evidence presented was clear but it wasn't believed and the conversations quickly shifted to blame. This dissonance was systemic miscommunication.[^6]

[^6]:And I was enchanted immediately.

This is how I got into product management, via conflict resolution. 

"Teams" are a group of folks that are dumped in a strange place. It doesn't matter how they got there. There's a lot of mismatch and miscommunication. I think it's important to listen to that. Because then you get them listen to the strange place. Sometimes its a simple as getting some developers to watch a person use something they built. Its incredible how quickly they can become fascinated with the strange place. [^7]

[^7]: Spoiler: I solved the problem this time by playing ambassador between the devs and designers. There's no solving real "problem." Sometimes dissonance is a feature... 

## Undiscovered Country

I’m so lucky to have found the web when I did because it’s been like an endless science project. That’s still true today. Every job I’ve taken has been, in part, because it involved some part of the stack that I don’t understand. [^7]

But it doesn’t end with technology. In order to design the future, you have to also understand human systems and what drives those systems. The benefit of working in tech is being able to work across a spectrum of industries at various inflection points. 

[^7]: I’ve been able to see tech, telecom, retail, and media industries from the inside as they wrestled with last mile potholes on the path to digital transformation. And I’ve built tools to designed to ease those pain points.

I’ve worked in agencies, enterprises, and startups as a developer, a UX architect, product manager, and solutions engineer. I’ve been a freelancer, consultant, director of product, and VP. [^6]

[^6]: read more about my [exploits](/history) here.

I get paid to architect solutions, design products and build teams. But there is a part of me that will always be a storyteller. Each job I’ve had has been part research, part anthropology, part trek to some unknown ecosystem.
