I'm not a big fan of blogs, but I've always had a special place in my heart for [Tufte.css](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/). So when I found out yesterday that [Jeff Eaton made an 11ty template](https://eleventufte.netlify.app/) from [Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/)'s underrated framework, it was enough to push me over edge and dedicate a full five minutes to spin up an instance.

- In this post I want to give out appropriate credits and approximate links.
- I want to mention my minimal intentions for the site. At best, it'll be a memex of thoughts that I can link to.
- Examine the system level problems with blogging, content management services, and innovations in knowledge management that still cling to the same constraints.

## Observations: 
- A personal blog with a minimal framework (or none at all) is "the right thing to do," because it's what  the open web was meant to look like. But it shouldn't be so hard.
- 11ty is breathlessly easy. So it Github, Netlify, and the other links in the toolchain. This particular solution is easy, like treading water. The problem is the current.
- For later: forces of the current. Changes in the current.
